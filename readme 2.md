=================

Thea Render is an exceptional quality external rendering solution that is now integrated on Blender as tight as possible. Features such as interactive rendering, materials editing, instancing support make it possible to work inside Blender creating astonishing results with a smooth workflow between Blender and Thea Render.

In addition, we have taken the decision to release the plugin under GPL (open source) that, we believe, fits the spirit of Blender development itself, meaning the plugin is free of charge (Thea Studio license is required).

The following video tutorial is an introduction on how to get started with our plugin for Blender modeling tool:
install the plugin, setup a scene, render it inside Blender using Thea Render and export the scene to Thea Studio.

You can also download the scene that was used at the tutorial (in Blender format) <a href="http://www.thearender.com/resources/meccano_plane_blender.zip">here.</a>
